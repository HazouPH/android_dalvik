/**
 * @brief JIT Profiling APIs
 *
 * The JIT Profiling API is used to report information about just-in-time
 * generated code that can be used by performance tools. The user inserts
 * calls in the code generator to report information before JIT-compiled
 * code goes to execution. This information is collected at runtime and used
 * by tools like Intel(R) VTune(TM) Amplifier to display performance metrics
 * associated with JIT-compiled code.
 *
 * These APIs can be used to\n
 * - **Profile trace-based and method-based JIT-compiled
 * code**. Some examples of environments that you can profile with these APIs:
 * dynamic JIT compilation of JavaScript code traces, JIT execution in OpenCL(TM)
 * software technology, Java/.NET managed execution environments, and custom
 * ISV JIT engines.
 * @code
 * #include <jitprofiling.h>
 *
 * if (iJIT_IsProfilingActive != iJIT_SAMPLING_ON) {
 *     return;
 * }
 *
 * iJIT_Method_Load jmethod = {0};
 * jmethod.method_id = iJIT_GetNewMethodID();
 * jmethod.method_name = "method_name";
 * jmethod.class_file_name = "class_name";
 * jmethod.source_file_name = "source_file_name";
 * jmethod.method_load_address = code_addr;
 * jmethod.method_size = code_size;
 *
 * iJIT_NotifyEvent(iJVM_EVENT_TYPE_METHOD_LOAD_FINISHED, (void*)&jmethod);
 * iJIT_NotifyEvent(iJVM_EVENT_TYPE_SHUTDOWN, NULL);
 * @endcode
 *
 *  * Expected behavior:
 *    * If any iJVM_EVENT_TYPE_METHOD_LOAD_FINISHED event overwrites an
 *      already reported method, then such a method becomes invalid and its
 *      memory region is treated as unloaded. VTune Amplifier displays the metrics
 *      collected by the method until it is overwritten.
 *    * If supplied line number information contains multiple source lines for
 *      the same assembly instruction (code location), then VTune Amplifier picks up
 *      the first line number.
 *    * Dynamically generated code can be associated with a module name.
 *      Use the iJIT_Method_Load_V2 structure.\n
 *      Clarification of some cases:
 *        * If you register a function with the same method ID multiple times,
 *          specifying different module names, then the VTune Amplifier picks up
 *          the module name registered first. If you want to distinguish the same
 *          function between different JIT engines, supply different method IDs for
 *          each function. Other symbolic information (for example, source file)
 *          can be identical.
 *
 * - **Analyze split functions** (multiple joint or disjoint code regions
 * belonging to the same function) **including re-JIT**
 * with potential overlapping of code regions in time, which is common in
 * resource-limited environments.
 * @code
 * #include <jitprofiling.h>
 *
 * unsigned int method_id = iJIT_GetNewMethodID();
 *
 * iJIT_Method_Load a = {0};
 * a.method_id = method_id;
 * a.method_load_address = 0x100;
 * a.method_size = 0x20;
 *
 * iJIT_Method_Load b = {0};
 * b.method_id = method_id;
 * b.method_load_address = 0x200;
 * b.method_size = 0x30;
 *
 * iJIT_NotifyEvent(iJVM_EVENT_TYPE_METHOD_LOAD_FINISHED, (void*)&a);
 * iJIT_NotifyEvent(iJVM_EVENT_TYPE_METHOD_LOAD_FINISHED, (void*)&b);
 * @endcode
 *
 *  * Expected behaviour:
 *      * If a iJVM_EVENT_TYPE_METHOD_LOAD_FINISHED event overwrites an
 *        already reported method, then such a method becomes invalid and
 *        its memory region is treated as unloaded.
 *      * All code regions reported with the same method ID are considered as
 *        belonging to the same method. Symbolic information (method name,
 *        source file name) will be taken from the first notification, and all
 *        subsequent notifications with the same method ID will be processed
 *        only for line number table information. So, the VTune Amplifier will map
 *        samples to a source line using the line number table from the current
 *        notification while taking the source file name from the very first one.\n
 *        Clarification of some cases:\n
 *          * If you register a second code region with a different source file
 *          name and the same method ID, then this information will be saved and
 *          will not be considered as an extension of the first code region, but
 *          VTune Amplifier will use the source file of the first code region and map
 *          performance metrics incorrectly.
 *          * If you register a second code region with the same source file as
 *          for the first region and the same method ID, then the source file will be
 *          discarded but VTune Amplifier will map metrics to the source file correctly.
 *          * If you register a second code region with a null source file and
 *          the same method ID, then provided line number info will be associated
 *          with the source file of the first code region.
 *
 * - **Explore inline functions** including multi-level hierarchy of
 * nested inline methods which shows how performance metrics are distributed through them.
 * @code
 * #include <jitprofiling.h>
 *

 *  //   [-- c --]                          3000        2000

 *  //  [---- b ----]                       2000        1000
 *  // [------------ a ----------------]    1000         n/a
 *
 * iJIT_Method_Load a = {0};
 * a.method_id = 1000;
 *
 * iJIT_Method_Inline_Load b = {0};
 * b.method_id = 2000;
 * b.parent_method_id = 1000;
 *
 * iJIT_Method_Inline_Load c = {0};
 * c.method_id = 3000;
 * c.parent_method_id = 2000;
 *
 * iJIT_Method_Inline_Load d = {0};
 * d.method_id = 2001;
 * d.parent_method_id = 1000;
 *
 * iJIT_NotifyEvent(iJVM_EVENT_TYPE_METHOD_LOAD_FINISHED, (void*)&a);
 * iJIT_NotifyEvent(iJVM_EVENT_TYPE_METHOD_INLINE_LOAD_FINISHED, (void*)&b);
 * iJIT_NotifyEvent(iJVM_EVENT_TYPE_METHOD_INLINE_LOAD_FINISHED, (void*)&c);
 * iJIT_NotifyEvent(iJVM_EVENT_TYPE_METHOD_INLINE_LOAD_FINISHED, (void*)&d);
 * @endcode
 *
 *  * Requirements:
 *      * Each inline (iJIT_Method_Inline_Load) method should be associated
 *        with two method IDs: one for itself; one for its immediate parent.
 *      * Address regions of inline methods of the same parent method cannot
 *        overlap each other.
 *      * Execution of the parent method must not be started until it and all
 *        its inline methods are reported.
 *  * Expected behaviour:
 *      * In case of nested inline methods an order of
 *        iJVM_EVENT_TYPE_METHOD_INLINE_LOAD_FINISHED events is not important.
 *      * If any event overwrites either inline method or top parent method,
 *        then the parent, including inline methods, becomes invalid and its memory
 *        region is treated as unloaded.
 *
 * **Life time of allocated data**\n
 * The client sends an event notification to the agent with event-specific
 * data, which is a structure. The pointers in the structure refer to memory
 * allocated by the client, which responsible for releasing it. The pointers are
 * used by the iJIT_NotifyEvent method to copy client's data in a trace file,
 * and they are not used after the iJIT_NotifyEvent method returns.
