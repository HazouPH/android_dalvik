This test does the comparison of "a" and "b" in the following cases:
1.Higher 32 bits of a < Higher 32 bits of b
2.Higher 32 bits of a > Higher 32 bits of b
3.Lower 32 bits of a < Lower 32 bits of b
4.a = b
5.Lower 32 bits of a > Lower 32 bits of b

Output : Prints to standard O/P stream only if expected value of "d" (20/21/22 for <,>,= respectively) is not found while comparison inside the for loops.
